RBXPri-Legacy-Code
==================

**RBXPri** was a way for scripters to escape from the secure environment of *vanilla Roblox* and become immersed in a contrasting free environment.
Originally, RBXPri was created around exploits and ideas of secession from secure sandboxes.  **RESL** (Roblox External Server Launcher) fits in there somewhere.
This repository **does not** contain the client; it **only contains** the code that was used to join games and launch servers from within the client.

The code in this repository is from RBXPri Blocco Edition v0.7.3.

I hope you'll have as much fun browsing the code as I did when I was writing the code.  Thank you.

RBXPri Legacy Code
==================

RBXPri was a way for scripters to escape from the secure environment of vanilla Roblox and become immersed in a contrasting free environment.
Originally, RBXPri was created around exploits and ideas of secession from secure sandboxes.  RESL (Roblox External Server Launcher) fits in there somewhere.
This repository does not contain the client; it only contains the code that was used to join games and launch servers from within the client.

I think my motivation behind this was seeing [gameserver.ashx][1] and [join.ashx][2].  I saw those two files, and said to myself that I had to improve them.
So I did.  And RBXPri Blocco Edition was born, with improved client- and server-side files.

Progress
--------

There are certain things that I **did** get to do
* Implement a client-sided command bar
* Simulate guests
* Test my client code
* Implement a menu system
* Insert a .rbxm file using code
* Insert a hopperbin using code
* Store locally persistent data

There are certain things that I **did not** get to do, like:
* Implement a server-sided command bar
* Test my server code
* Add a server-sided GUI to ban people

Information
-----------
The code in this repository is from **RBXPri Blocco Edition v0.7.3** (released 8/29/2011).

I hope you'll have as much fun browsing the code as I did when I was writing the code.  Thank you.
